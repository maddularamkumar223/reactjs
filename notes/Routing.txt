Routing

It is used to render from one webpage to another webpage without reload the page.

The routing is not supported by the react library so we need to install one dependices

react-router-dom 

Three parameters are imp
 
1. BrowserRouter : All the components should be wrap inside the Browser Router.

2. Switch: It will compare the values if it match it stops there only.

3. Route: Inside this we are creating the paths.
	   It has two attributes
		1. path
		2. component


How to access the path
	To access path we need to use the Link/NavLink which is present inside the react-router-dom.
