State

It is a JS object.
It represents the current position/situation of the component.
It will be handled inside the component.
It is mutable in nature.
It is used to hold and store the data.
It is storing the null or an object.


In a class-based component, state is present internally.
In a function-based component, state is not present


If I want to update the state in the class based component
we need to use the this.setState method
