JSX
It is the combination of both html and js.
It is a file extension.
It is a structure for the JSX

Rules of jsx

1. Tags always contain closing tags
2. className, htmlFor
3. We should wrap same level of elements should be wrap in a parent


React Fragments

It act like parent for the elements which avoids the extra node us.
 
1. <React.Fragment>
		//code
  </React.Fragment>

2. <>
	//code
   </>

Difference between first and second syntax is in the first syntax we can give a key attribute in second syntax it is not possible.

JSX Expression

1. The representation of the JSX expression is "{}".
2. If we want to render dynamic data that we are using the jsx expression.
