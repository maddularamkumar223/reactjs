Components

It is a core building block.
We are combining all the components in a parent.
Components are reusable.
We can import and export the components.

Component name starts with an uppercase letter.
Component file extension should be .JSX.


Types of components

1. Class-Based Component.
2. Function-Based Component.

1. Class-Based Component

	1. We should import React.
	2. It follows inheritance where we are using the extends 	keyword.
	3. We should use the render method to run the JSX.
	4. It follows the es6 classes.

Syntax:  class ComponentName extends React.component{
	
		constructor(){
			super();
		}
		
		render(){
			//code
		}
	}
	
	export default Component Name;

2. Function-Based Component

	1. It is very easy compare to class based component
	2. We need to return the JSX to display the data.
	3. In this, we don't have a render method.
	4. It doesn't have any life-cycle methods.

	syntax : let Componentname = ()=>{
		return{
			//code
		}
	}
	export default component Name;


1. We need to create a root component with the name of App.jsx
2. We can call the component in two ways.
	1. Paired 

		<ComponentName></Componentname>		

	2. unpaired
		
		<Componentname/>
3. You should import the components.
