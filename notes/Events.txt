Events

It is used to interact with the users.
The events are the same in the JS also. 
In react, we will call events as synthetic events.
It is returning an object.

1. In JS, we are using the event attributes with lowercase only onclick(), but in React JS we are using the camelCase onClick()
2. In JS while we are using the events there we are invoking the function "onclick = "functionname()" but in react we will nor invoke the function "onClick = {functionName}.
3. In JS to call the function, we will not use the curly brackets, but in react, to call function, we need to use the curly brackets.

In react, we are creating the event handlers.
